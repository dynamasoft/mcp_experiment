# MCP Experiment

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a **Math Computational Protocol (MCP)** server and client. The server provides tools for basic mathematical operations, while the client interacts with the server using an AI-powered agent.

## Features

- **MCP Server**: Implements tools for addition and multiplication.
- **MCP Client**: Uses an AI agent to interact with the server and perform computations.
- **Integration with LangChain**: Leverages LangChain for creating a ReAct agent.
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Model**: Powered by GPT-4 for intelligent responses.
